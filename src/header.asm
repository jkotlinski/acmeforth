; Parameter stack
; The x register contains the current stack depth.
; It is initially 0 and decrements when items are pushed.
; The parameter stack is placed in zeropage to save space.
; (E.g. lda $FF,x takes less space than lda $FFFF,x)
; We use a split stack that store low-byte and high-byte
; in separate ranges on the zeropage, so that popping and
; pushing gets faster (only one inx/dex operation).
